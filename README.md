- 👋 Hi, I’m @matcpro
- 👀 I’m interested in people and data on micro and macrolevel.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about cyber security and personal data, within GDPR EU regulations.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hacks for mainstream implementation of data protection in HR processes.
- matcpro/matcpro is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
